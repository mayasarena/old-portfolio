                            <h1>Background Information</h1>
                            The following case study is a condensed overview of my 16-month Master’s thesis. I specialized in Human-Computer Interaction, and 
                            did research on how students interact with focus tracking apps.

                            <h2 class="padding-top-2">Abstract</h2>
                            Procrastination is a prevalent issue among university students, and it is
                            important to investigate potential interventions. This thesis describes the
                            design and implementation of a self-tracking mobile application that students
                            can use to track their study sessions. The aim of this study was to investigate
                            the impact that the application has on procrastination behaviour, along with an
                            exploration of how students interpret their study data. A pilot study revealed
                            that participants experienced an improvement in their focus, time management
                            skills, and accountability. Following this, results from a six-week randomized
                            controlled trial indicated that only the control group experienced a significant
                            decrease in procrastination scores, however there was no significant difference
                            between the two groups. Additionally, I identified themes that describe how
                            students interpret their data and additional impacts that the application had on
                            study behaviour, which led to a discussion about design implications and areas
                            for future research.

                        <h1>Motivation</h1>
                        Have you ever felt stuck in a never-ending cycle of procrastination, especially during your university days? 
                        Research shows 80% to 95% of university students face this challenge, leading to negative outcomes such as stress and poor well-being. 
                        Traditional solutions such as training programs or therapy are costly and time-consuming. 
                        <br><br>Leveraging the trend of tracking data for health, wellbeing, and productivity (also called the Quantified Self), 
                        focus-tracking apps offer a cost-effective and accessible intervention. The question remains: Are focus-tracking apps effective for students? Let's find out!
                        
                        
                        <h1 class="h1-padding-top">Persuasive Design</h1>
                        My literature review identified three persuasive element classes. Many studies test apps with all features, making it hard to discern their individual effects. 
                        Thus, our focus was on a purely quantified self application, isolating the variable for assessment. 
                        In non-research contexts, apps typically combine elements from multiple classes.

                        <h1>Design</h1>
                        Diving into the application's design, it's important to note that this was an HCI research project, not a UX design project; therefore, the design process wasn't the main focus. 
                        For the app's design, I drew inspiration from existing focus-tracking apps on the market and incorportated recommendations for self-tracking apps
                        that I identified during my literature review. Three main components went into the design of the application:

                                    I carefully assessed all the data visualizations in popular focus apps, and used this knowledge to construct a dashboard for the app.

                        I drew rough paper prototypes followed by wireframes. Finally, I created a high-fidelity prototype in Figma.

                        During development, I conducted a usability study to ensure that the app design was usable prior to moving onto the Pilot and Main studies. 
                        I asked eight participants to think out loud as they performed some tasks on the high-fidelity Figma prototype, then they filled out a System Usability Scale.
                        Key insights from the usability test are outlined below:

                        For the main study, I conducted a 6-week randomized controlled trial with a control group consisting of nine participants (did not use the app) 
                        and an experimental group consisting of nine participants (used the app). Both groups responded to an initial and final procrastination questionnaire, 
                        along with weekly procrastination questionnaires to assess subtle changes.
