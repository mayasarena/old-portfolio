                            A big issue that University students deal with is procrastination. 
                            However, currently available interventions for procrastination can be expensive and 
                            time-consuming. Therefore, <b>I aimed to discover if tracking study time with the help of 
                            technology can help improve study behaviour and decrease procrastination.</b>

                        <h1>Design Process</h1>
                        The prototype was inspired by currently available productivity tracking apps on the market. <span class="highlight-text purple">No gamified or social features were added, because the study aimed to solely explore how self-tracking features impact procrastination. </span>
                        First, I made some rough hand sketches of the app. Then, I created wireframes, followed by a high-fidelity prototype. The final high-fidelity Figma prototype is shown below:

                        The purpose of the usability study was to evaluate the usability of the application and to identify areas for improvement. 8 participants aged 21 to 30 years old were recruited. 
                        Participants were instructed to think out loud as they performed tasks in the high-fidelity Figma prototype, and then filled out the System Usability Scale. <span class="highlight-text purple">The resulting average SUS score was 83.75.</span> <b>Participants found some of the charts confusing, so I added a button to each chart that can be clicked to display an explanation of the chart.</b>

                        I implemented StudyTracker using SwiftUI and it was compatible with iOS 15.0+. Users were able to time their study sessions using the timer on the homepage. 
                        There was also a history section that allowed users to edit or delete previous sessions. The app featured tags so users can tag each study session as a different subject. Finally, the app provided feedback about study time in the form of text and charts.

                        After the 10 days, I conducted semi-structured interviews over Zoom about their experiences using the app.

                        The interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis with an inductive approach. The 4 main themes that emerged are described below:

                        <h1>Reflection</h1>
                        Due to lack of participants, it was difficult to conclude whether or not the
                         application had an impact on procrastination habits. In fact,
                          statistical analysis showed that <span class="highlight-text purple">the control group experienced a greater decrease 
                          in procrastination scores than the experimental group.</span> Perhaps the app was not engaging enough, 
                          or consistently tracking study sessions is too much of a burden on students. Overall, self-tracking applications 
                          may be able to help students with procrastination and study habits however  <span class="highlight-text purple">additional persuasive features are needed to keep users engaged.</span>

                                    <b>Ensuring That Data is Accurate:</b> Every self-tracking app should provide the users with options to edit or delete entries, especially if the tracking is semi-automated. This is important because users place a lot of value on the accuracy of their data when it comes to analyzing their data.

                                    <b>Optimizing Data Visualizations: </b>There was a lack of pattern in the type of feedback that participants preferred. This suggests that a wide variety of charts should be provided, since there is no "one size fits all" solution. It's a good idea to also display the same type of information, but in different types of charts (i.e., bar charts vs line charts). Ideally, self-tracking apps should include a customizable dashboard.
