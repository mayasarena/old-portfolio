                            This is a personal project that I was inspired to complete after hearing friends complain about how hard it is to find a job after graduating. I also ran into my own struggles trying to find internships during school, and became frustrated with job search websites showing me job postings that I wasn't qualified for. I noticed a big issue with job search platforms and the filters they have in place. I also noticed how little school really prepares us for the "real world", and decided that it would be helpful for there to be a one-stop-shop to prepare students and new grads for their careers.

                        <h1>Market Research</h1>
                        I sent out a survey to 5 participants to gather some insights about their current pain points when it comes to job-posting applications and looking for jobs as a new grad or student.

                        <img src="assets/img/kickstart/survey-summary.png">

                        I gathered all responses to gain a clearer picture of the issues that users currently face, and how they think they can be solved.

                        <h1 class="h1-padding-top">The Problem</h1>
                        <span class="highlight-text blue">Current job posting websites are insufficient for students and new grads searching for jobs, because job postings are inaccurate making it difficult for students to find jobs that they are qualified for</span>. Furthermore, many students/new grads feel overwhelmed while looking for their first job because they feel unprepared and unqualified. Students/new grads 
                        would like to see more transparent and more reliable job postings, and more filters while searching for jobs; they would also like more tools to help them better prepare for the job search.

                        I took elements from the surveys and encompassed them within a persona. I wanted to make sure that the persona accurately portrayed a new grad, who may be a little anxious about applying to jobs for the first time. Another big problem that people faced was a lack of experience right out of school, due to other obligations during their degrees such as needing to have part-time jobs to pay for school or dealing with mental health issues. Therefore, it was important that Daniel had no experience right out of his engineering degree.

                        <h1>User Journey Map</h1>
                        A user journey map was created to better understand the pain points that Daniel experiences while using a job-posting app. I tried to identify areas of improvement and extra features that could be added to the application.

However, this isn't up to the app to decide, rather it's up to companies who are opening up positions. The best thing we can do as designers is ease the process - for example, making it easier for new grads to find the roles that are already out there and that are best suited for them.
