                            After completing my thesis, I decided it would be fun to completely redesign StudyTracker, which is the app that I designed for my thesis research. 
                            This time, I wanted no constraints on the design. For reference, StudyTracker was purposefully designed without the addition of social or gamified features, 
                            focusing solely on self-tracking as a form of persuasion for the sake of my research. 
                            Therefore, I was unable to incorporate many participants’ suggestions and feedback in the final design. For this project, 
                            I will be revisiting the research that I collected during my thesis and using it to re-iterate on the StudyTracker design, following a Design Thinking process.

                        <h1>Re-Analyzing User Research</h1>
                        I began the process by re-analyzing data that I collected during my master’s thesis. Data was collected through various methods, 
                        including usability studies, user interviews, and user surveys. Participants also had a chance to use StudyTracker 1.0, 
                        after which I collected data about their experience through surveys and interviews. To learn more about the research,

                        <h1 class="h1-padding-top">Why do students slack when it comes to coursework?</h1>
                        I dove deeper into the interview transcripts from my initial Pilot study to assess why exactly my participants procrastinated in the first place. 
                        Although this was not the question I was trying to answer during my original study, I still collected enough data to re-analyze it using this lens.

                        <h1 class="h1-padding-top">What tools do students like to use to help them study?</h1>
                        Next, I wanted to see which methods students choose to combat their bad study habits, in order to understand what is attractive as a tool to students. 
                        I revisited preliminary research that I collected about my participants. These results were gathered from 18 undergraduate university students. 
                        <br><br>

                        Students enjoy using planners to help them with studying, followed by tracking time, putting their phone away, and studying with friends. 
                        It’s evident that planning is an important variable for students who need to manage multiple courses.

                        <h1 class="h1-padding-top">The downfalls of tracking apps</h1>
                        During my thesis, I came up with several design implications for tracking apps. Taking these implications into consideration will allow me to understand the downfalls of tracking
                        apps and how I can improve the design and features of this new app for the users. <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        Most importantly, users need <b>more immersion</b> when using tracking apps. It can be difficult to remember to track, 
                        and users need reminders to help them <b>form the habit of tracking</b>. Furthermore, <b>users need help interpreting the data that the app is providing</b>.

                        I created a persona so I can empathize more with the user and understand their needs, behaviours, and goals. 
                        Amanda is a hardworking student living in the GTA who is trying to juggle her academic, social, and personal life.<br><br>

                        I created an empathy map to gain a deeper understanding of Amanda’s thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This will help me better address user needs when I design. 
                        <br><br> <img src="assets/img/studybuddy/empathy-map.png"><br><br>
                        Although Amanda recognizes that she needs to improve her study habits and time management skills, she just can’t seem to make the changes that she wants to. 
                        She needs a tool that will help her balance her time with school, motivate her to study, and help her be more productive. 
                        <h1 class="h1-padding-top">Customer Journey Map</h1>
                        Next, I created a customer journey map to gain insights into how the user would interact with focus-tracking apps. 
                        This helped me identify pain points and issues with current focus-tracking apps, resulting in improvements and features for my product.

                        and a customer journey map, I formulated a problem statement which will help guide me through the redesign process of StudyTracker. 
                        It’s evident that bad study habits and procrastination are hard to combat without the right tools. From insights gained through empathizing, 
                        it seems that there’s a clear pattern when it comes to students struggling with unproductivity:<br><br>
                        <img src="assets/img/studybuddy/cycle.png" class="smaller_img"><br><br>
                        We need a tool that can come in and help students break this cycle. This knowledge helped me come up with my problem statement: <b>How might I redesign
                            the study tracking experience to make it more immersive, practical for students, and effective?
