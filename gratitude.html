                            This design brief was given to us during the Emerging Interaction Techniques course at Carleton University. We were challenged
                            with developing a new way to express <b>gratitude</b> using technology and design. The brief encouraged us to think creatively about how technology
                            can be used to spread positivity and foster a culture of kindness and appreciation. The scope of the project was broad, allowing us to focus on
                            different groups, artifacts, and mediums for expressing gratitude.

                        My idea stemmed from my own observations and experiences during the Covid pandemic. I noticed that people were becoming more distant, and daily interactions lacked any form of connection. It was harder to hear people in passing due to masks and difficult to interpret their facial expressions.
                        I felt that we could address these issues and <span class="highlight-text pink">find a way to better express feelings of gratitude during daily interactions despite wearing masks</span>.

                        The design was intentionally made simple to avoid distractions. We chose to use an LED-light because we hypothesized that it would be an <span class="highlight-text pink">effective way of 
                        quickly redirecting the receiver's attention to the heart</span>. We made sure that the wires were long enough to allow the battery to be placed in our pockets during testing.
                        The switch was positioned near the mask because we envisioned that the higher-fidelity prototype
                        of this design wouldn't involve any exposed wires, but instead it would have a button embedded into the mask to activate the light.

                        <h1>Discussion</h1>
                        Although participants seemed to enjoy the device, we had a different experience during our autoethnographic study. The device was difficult to use and made us feel awkward. However, we believe that with a sleeker design (i.e., if the prototype was higher-fidelity), these problems would no longer persist. Participants also had varying reactions
                        to the device, with some loving it and some hating it. Novelty may have an effect on positive reactions to the device; if the device were more widely used, would participants still feel such connectedness?

                        <h1 class="h1-padding-top">Takeaways</h1>
                        The design of a device is very important; considering this was a mid-fidelity prototype, it was difficult to decipher whether the device would be enjoyable for the wearer. There were many flaws in our mid-fidelity prototype, and a future study would ideally involve a higher-fidelity prototype making it less awkward to wear in public. We learned that,
